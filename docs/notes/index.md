The Notes pane on the right side of the page lets you capture and save insights you've gained during your modeling processes.

To assist with publishing a paper, the Notes pane lets you organize insights into sections such as *Abstract*, *Intro*, *Methods*, *Results*, *Discussion*, or *References*.

## Save an insight as a note

Any notes you save are associated with the current tab only. This means you can create unique notes for each resource (publications, documents, datasets, models, workflows) in your project.
