You can create workflows to calibrate or to configure models that leverage:

- Data from the Terarium database.
- Custom data from your uploaded from your computer.
- Data stored in a GitHub repository. 

## Add a dataset to your project

For information on finding or uploading datasets, see [Gather modeling resources](../modeling-resources)

## Dataset descriptions

Terarium relies on LLMs to make sense of datasets and enable data transformations of:

- Descriptions
- Annotations
- Features

<p class="procedure">To view the raw data in a dataset</p>

1. Open the dataset.
2. Click the :octicons-file-24:{ aria-hidden="true" } **Data** tab.

### Enrich dataset descriptions

Terarium also has an enrichment service that can automatically populate dataset descriptions based on related publications you've identified. When you choose to enrich a dataset, the service looks at your related publications to find and apply definitions for concepts.

<p class="procedure">To enrich a dataset description</p>

1. Click **Add resources to describe this data**.
2. Select the resources you want to use and click **Use these resources to enrich descriptions**.
